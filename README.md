# MIPS-Processor
 Implemented 16-bit MIPS Pipelined Processor in Verilog-HDL on Xilinx Platform. 
 The processor can perform 28 different operations. The operations were successfully executed using an FPGA.
 
 Verilog files for different blocks are in their corresponding folders.
 Different blocks are:
 ALU,Program memory,Register Bank,Stall control block,Data Memory Block,Jump Control Block,Write Back Block.
 All blocks are then integrated into the final module of MIPS-16 bit file.
 Every module of block is accompanied with its test bench for simulation.
